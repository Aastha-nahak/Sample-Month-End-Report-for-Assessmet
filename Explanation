1. What are your insights and learnings from this data in a simple easy to understand way as if you are explaining to a 10 year old child?
ANSWER
--> Insights & Learnings (Explained Simply, Like to a 10-Year-Old)
Imagine you have a school day with different subjects like Maths, English, Sports, and Art.
If you spend most of your time doing homework for one subject, you won’t have enough time for the others. The same thing is happening here.
Insight 1: Most time is spent on “Developer” and “Consultant/Architect” work
The data shows that the largest share of time is spent on technical and advisory activities rather than pure sales work.
What this means (simple)-The Sales employee is spending a lot of time helping solve problems instead of finding new customers and growing business.
from data Developer and Consultant/Architect categories have much higher hours compared to Admin or other categories.
Insight 2: Some time is recorded as “Unknown”
There are hours where it is not clear what work was done.
What this means (simple)-It’s like saying “I was busy” but not knowing with what. If we don’t know, we can’t fix or improve it.
from data The “Unknown” category has a noticeable number of hours, showing lack of clarity in tracking.
Insight 3: A few clients take up most of the time
Only a small number of companies or internal groups consume a very large part of the total working hours.
What this means (simple)-Some people are asking for help again and again, while others need very little help.
from data 'Top 2–3 clients show much higher hours compared to the rest'.
Insight 4: More time does not always mean more value
Just because a client takes more time does not automatically mean they are the most profitable or important.
What this means (simple)-Spending too much time on one thing means less time for new opportunities.
Business learning This creates opportunity cost—time spent here cannot be spent elsewhere.

2. What best practices should be followed to improve efficiency - based on your insights?
ANSWER
-->Best Practice 1: Clearly separate Sales work from Technical work
Sales should focus on customers, deals, and relationships
Technical teams should handle deep technical problem-solving
Why this helps-Sales time is used for growth, not execution.
Best Practice 2: Remove the “Unknown” category
Make time logging clear and mandatory
Use fixed categories so every hour is explained
Why this helps-Clear data leads to better decisions and accountability.
Best Practice 3: Track value along with time
Compare hours spent per client with business value or revenue
Identify clients that take high effort but give low returns
Why this helps-Time is invested where it creates the most impact.
Best Practice 4: Protect dedicated sales time
Block fixed time for sales planning, follow-ups, and new leads
Avoid pulling sales staff into unnecessary technical discussions
Why this helps-Improves focus, consistency, and long-term growth.
Best Practice 5: Standardize and delegate repeat work
Use templates, documents, and standard processes
Delegate routine tasks to junior staff or automation tools
Why this helps-Senior resources focus on high-value work instead of repeat tasks.
